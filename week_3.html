    <h2> Week 3 </h2>
    <h3> Day 1 </h3>
    <p> 
        As I noticed that just leaving everything to the end of the week 
        and trying to remember what I did wasn't effective, I've decided to
        keep a daily log of the things I do so that it becomes easy to 
        reflect and write a proper weekly journal.
    </p>
    <p> 
        Today I read the tasks
        for the week and must admit that I wasn't expecting to see LC Hard problems.
        I am very rusty, but I like those kind of exercises, I will try to solve
        some problems to warm up before going at them.
    </p>
    <p> 
        I am also trying to get ahead on the certification and learning
        ahead of time. I am planning on doing the AWS Machine Learning Specialty, 
        though I'm starting with an associate-level course to have a solid foundation.
        I'm nout sure if I will be prepared enough for the ML certification, but if not,
        at least I will get the Developer one. Today I learned about Load Balancers in AWS.
    </p>
    <h3> Day 2 </h3>
    <p> 
        I continued with DSA practice with videos and some problems on
        Leetcode. I also learned about Auto Scaling Groups in AWS. 
    </p>
    <h3> Day 3 </h3>
    <p> 
        Today I couldn't do much and even missed some onboarding meetings,
        as I attended a conference at Google about generative AI. Though it 
        was very business-orientated and I didn't learn much about the 
        technical aspect and implementation methods, it was very interesting
        to see what Google has to offer in terms of AI solutions.
    </p>
    <h3> Day 4 </h3>
    <p> 
        Today I solved the LC Hard problem by scaling the solution of 
        easier variants of the problem. It was a fun exercise. I also learned
        about relational databases and Aurora for AWS. 
    </p>
    <h3> Day 5 </h3>
    <p> 
        Today, I 'translated' the solution I did from Python to Go and solved the 
        individual problem assignment. I chose a problem that had a similar solution
        to the one I already did. 
    </p>
    <p> I also attended the 'Newbie Friday' event. I had fun. Shame I had to leave early.
    </p>
    <h3> Weekend </h3>
    <p> 
        I know I shouldn't do much on weekends and try to rest, but I didn't organize properly. It's okay, 
        as the tasks I have left are just uploading the stuff I already did rather than doing everyting. 
    </p>
    <h3> Overall Conclusion </h3>
    <p>
        I am having a good time and learning a lot. I am excited for what is to come and I am sure that I will
        be ready for it. 
    </p>
    <p>
        P.S: I am still working on a good system to be more efficient. 
    </p>
    <p>
        P.P.S: This is still a work in progress, the plain html will change soon, I promise.
